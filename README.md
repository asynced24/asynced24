## 👋 Hey, I’m Aryan

I’m a software engineer who enjoys building **reliable backend systems**, automating messy workflows, and turning vague problems into working solutions.  
Currently an M.Eng student at **McMaster University**.

I like code that’s **simple, readable, and hard to break** — and I’m actively strengthening my fundamentals by building real things, not just following tutorials.

---

## What I like working on
- Backend services and automation
- Distributed and cloud-native systems
- Internal tools that make engineers’ lives easier

---

## Tools I use
- **Languages:** Java, Python, JavaScript, Groovy, SQL  
- **Backend & Infra:** AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform  
- **Dev Tools:** Git, Linux, CI/CD (Jenkins)

---

## A few things I’ve built
- **Distributed Log Analytics System**  
  Event ingestion using Kinesis → Lambda → Athena, provisioned with Terraform

- **Smart Manufacturing Quality Control**  
  Real-time defect detection using computer vision on edge devices

- **Fetal Health Classification Pipeline**  
  End-to-end ML pipeline with strong evaluation and validation metrics
